What I'm doing now.

"Iâ€™m 21. After I graduated from high school, I literally did nothing for 3 years ðŸ˜±. It was a long gap in my education. However, I learned two important things during that time: I love Music and Engineering. Now, I am planning to enroll in University."

## Study

I'm studying 35 hours a week.

## Music

I'm making a song a week.

## Part-time job

I'm doing part-time job as an engineer 3 days a week.
(I'll quit for my study time)
