What I'm doing now.


>"Iâ€™m 21. After I graduated from high school, I literally did nothing for 3 years ðŸ˜±. It was a long gap in my education. However, I learned two important things during that time: I love Music and Engineering. Now, I am planning to enroll in University."


## Study

I study 35 hours a week.
